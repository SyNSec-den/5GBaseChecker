This folder contains the software for layer 1 of the OpenAirInterface eNB and UE as well as the unitary simulators

|-- PHY			   // contains all signal processing related to physical layer (used in real-time AND simulation)

General remarks: every directory contains at least defs.h (for declaration of structure and functions), vars.h (for definitions of variables), and extern.h (variables are defined only once in xxx-softmodem.c (for real-time HW operation) or a top-level simulation (in SIMULATION/xxx), if variables are needed in another file, use extern.h)
